# 👋 Hi, I’m cyber8Jason!

I'm a curious and motivated **Junior developer** who enjoys solving problems and learning how things work behind the scenes. I’m currently focused on **backend development** and want to grow into the world of **AI & machine learning** one step at a time.  

I believe in learning by doing — and I'm excited to keep building, improving, and sharing my journey here on GitHub.
